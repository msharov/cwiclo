<h1>Memory management</h1>

</header>
<main id="content">
<p>
The cwiclo programming philosophy considers memory management to be the
most essential consideration in every project. Apps consist primarily
of ways to move data from one place to another, hence every design must
start by specifying how data is stored, who owns it, how it is created,
and when it is destroyed. Any algorithms for processing the data are
then chosen to fit its structure.
</p><p>
The low-level memory API in cwiclo is similar to that of the standard
library, providing methods of managing typed allocated memory. The code
is located in <tt>memory.h</tt>, containing allocation primitives,
<tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt>, object initialization, pointer and
iterator utilities, and the necessary C++ ABI support normally present
in <tt>libstdc++</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Allocators</h2>
<p>
The standard libc <tt>malloc</tt> is used for all memory allocation.
Custom allocators are not supported anywhere in cwiclo because the task
they are supposed to optimize - fast and efficient allocation of a large
number of very small objects - should never be necessary. The necessity
of defining strict object ownership and lifetime makes the frequent
practice of creating objects with new and throwing them "up in the air"
as <tt>shared_ptr</tt>s inappropriate. Small objects should be created
in a vector, so that their ownership, lifetime, and access could be
managed by that vector's owning object, thus obviating the need for a
custom allocator tailored to small objects.
</p><p>
Because cwiclo has no exceptions, memory allocations never throw, but
rather <tt>abort</tt> on failure. Exiting in this manner is the only
reasonable thing to do because the app can do nothing to correct this
problem. An often repeated admonition to "free unnecessary resources"
in this situation is inappropriate because the app should not have
allocated any unnecessary resources to begin with. Furthermore, on Linux,
the main target platform, failed memory allocations typically result in
the process being killed by the OOM killer before the allocation failure
is even reported to the process.
</p><p>
All cwiclo allocations go through the <tt>_realloc</tt> function, which
calls libc <tt>realloc</tt> and aborts on failure. <tt>_alloc</tt>
forwards to <tt>_realloc</tt>. Global <tt>new</tt> variants inline to
<tt>_alloc</tt>. Global <tt>delete</tt>s inline to normal <tt>free</tt>.
Placement <tt>new</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> do nothing. Placement
<tt>new</tt> is constexpr, allowing calling constexpr constructors
this way.
</p><p>
Following the "no naked new" principle, constructors can be called
using <tt>construct_at&lt;Rect&gt; (parea, 0,0,80,24);</tt> instead of
the naked placement new. Likewise, the destructor can be called using
<tt>destroy_at</tt>. For object arrays there are <tt>destroy (begin(a),
end(a))</tt> and <tt>destroy_n (begin(a), size(a))</tt>. Uninitialized
plain memory can be constructed into an object array using
<tt>uninitialized_default_construct (f,l)</tt> and
<tt>uninitialized_default_construct_n (f,n)</tt>.
</p><p>
The allocator functions above are generally only used for implementing
containers. You seldom need to use them directly.
</p>

<h2>Containers</h2>
<p>
Low-level memory containers include <tt>std::initializer_list</tt>
and <tt>unique_ptr</tt> templates. <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> is an internal
compiler construct (which is why it must be in <tt>std::</tt>) that is
created when objects are brace-initialized.  For example, if you were to
create <tt>vector a = {1,2,3};</tt>, an <tt>std::initializer_list</tt>
object containing a pointer to the array of numbers and the size of
that array is created by the compiler and passed to the appropriate
<tt>vector</tt> constructor.
</p><p>
<tt>std::initializer_list</tt> has the standard STL container interface,
<tt>begin</tt>, <tt>end</tt>, and <tt>size</tt> members for iteration.
There is an <tt>operator[]</tt> for random access. There is no public
constructor because you will never directly create one of these.
</p><p>
The other container here is <tt>unique_ptr</tt>, a smart pointer template
that owns the allocated object and frees it in the destructor. For
example: <tt>auto name = make_unique&lt;string&gt;("gandalf");</tt>
creates a <tt>unique_ptr&lt;string&gt;</tt> object owning a pointer to
a string with the value "gandalf". The use of <tt>make_unique</tt> is
recommended to specify the object type only once and to reinforce the
habit of not using naked <tt>new</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> explicitly manages ownership with the <tt>get</tt>
method giving an unowned object pointer, while <tt>release</tt>
relinquishes ownership to the caller. <tt>reset</tt> deletes the object
and sets the internal pointer to a new value; this can be used to give
ownership to the <tt>unique_ptr</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> also contains passthrough functionality for mimicking
bare pointer behavior, such as <tt>bool nullptr</tt>-testing, pointer
comparisons, as well as the <tt>*</tt> and <tt>-&gt;</tt> operators.
<tt>unique_ptr</tt> thus prevents memory leaks and use-after-free,
while acting much like a bare pointer, making it the preferred choice
over the latter in most circumstances.
</p><p>
A frequently asked question here is why there is no <tt>shared_ptr</tt>
or <tt>weak_ptr</tt>. The reason is that those containers violate cwiclo's
strict ownership policy. Each object must have exactly one owner, who
then determines the lifetime of each owned object. The "up in the air"
ownership structure provided by <tt>shared_ptr</tt> should never be used.
</p>

<h2>Iterators</h2>
<p>
Iterator-based algorithm implementation is aided by
the <tt>iterator_traits</tt> template, which allows
discovery of relevant iterator properties. You can get
<tt>iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::value_type</tt>, showing what the iterator
iterates over, <tt>difference_type</tt>, for storing iterator distances,
value <tt>pointer</tt>, value <tt>reference</tt>, <tt>const_pointer</tt>
and <tt>const_reference</tt>. By using <tt>iterator_traits</tt> you can
set internal variable types independently of iterator type, supporting
pointers, <tt>void*</tt>, and complex iterators with the same code.
</p><p>
Functions for adjusting iterators are also required to support
<tt>void*</tt>. Academic C++ frowns upon untyped storage, but
with cwiclo's attitude that types are not sacred, raw storage is
common and <tt>void</tt> pointers occasionally occur. So here we have
<tt>advance(p)</tt> to increment the iterator given by reference. It works
with normal pointers, complex iterators, and <tt>void*</tt>.  <tt>np =
next(p)</tt> is a non-modifying version that returns <tt>p+1</tt>.
<tt>np = next(p,n)</tt> returns <tt>p+n</tt>. Complementary
<tt>prev</tt> returns <tt>--p</tt> or <tt>p-n</tt>. And finally there
is <tt>distance(p,q)</tt>, returning the <tt>q-p</tt>. Use these and
make friends with <tt>void*</tt>.
</p><p>
Algorithms that need a pointer to the actual data can use the
<tt>to_address</tt> function to convert a complex iterator into a
raw pointer. This works with iterators that support <tt>-&gt;</tt>,
<tt>unique_ptr</tt>, and, of course, normal pointers.
</p>

<h2>Move utilities</h2>
<p>
One of C++11's great features is move semantics, and cwiclo implements
the standard support functions for it. There is <tt>move</tt> function
that converts an l-value to an r-value, "moving" the given object. The
<tt>forward&lt;T&gt;</tt> template forwards an l-value or r-value as-is.
This is used in template wrappers to forward arguments that may be either.
</p><p>
<tt>swap(a,b)</tt> uses <tt>move</tt> to efficiently swap arguments.
There is an array version as well, swapping two arrays element by element.
<tt>iter_swap(p,q)</tt> swaps what iterators <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt>
point to. <tt>auto olda = exchange(a,b)</tt> moves <tt>b</tt> into
<tt>a</tt> and returns what was in <tt>a</tt>. A half-swap, if you will;
handy when resetting a resource: <tt>free (exchange (p, nullptr))</tt>.
</p>

<h2>copy</h2>
<p>
Copying memory is as down-to-the-metal as it gets and in C it is done
by <tt>memcpy</tt> with the several problems that come with it. The
first is that it is not always inlined to <tt>rep movs</tt>, creating an
unnecessary call frame that invariably increases emitted code size. Not
inlining the call also loses the element size information provided
by the type of the argument and sometimes by the size. This requires
the implementation of memcpy to either be implemented using <tt>rep
movsb</tt>, or to have extra chunking code, increasing complexity and
setup time, and decreasing performance for small blocks. The second
is that it takes the destination argument first, while we usually
first consider the source of the data.  And the third is that in C++
some types are non-trivial and must be copied by <tt>operator=</tt>,
requiring use of a different interface.
</p><p>
The standard library, and cwiclo, provide <tt>copy (f,l,t)</tt> and
<tt>copy_n (f,n,t)</tt> for this purpose, choosing the correct copy
approach for each type, either copying one-by-one, or by forwarding
trivial types to <tt>memcpy</tt>. The cwiclo implementation explicitly
forces inline <tt>rep movs</tt> with an appropriate chunk size. This is
one of the few places where inline assembly was required since C++ has
no other means of instructing the compiler to use string instructions.
A more direct <tt>rep_movs (f,n,t)</tt> is provided for that purpose, with
parameters equivalent to <tt>copy_n</tt>, but <tt>f</tt> and <tt>t</tt>
are required to be pointers and are passed by reference to take advantage
of <tt>rep movs</tt> instruction's ability to advance them both.
</p><p>
Another reason for forcing <tt>rep movs</tt> is to maintain a strict
forward copy order. Because <tt>memcpy</tt> does not specify that, libc
developers tried to "help" us by making copying in an unspecified order,
presumably because they could make large copies faster. People like
me, who frequently look at assembly, tend to select copy operations
directly based on direction when the regions overlap. To shift data
left, use forward copy, implemented by <tt>rep movs</tt>. To shift data
right, use backward copy, implemented by first setting the direction
flag. In C, these two kinds of moves naturally map to <tt>memcpy</tt>
and <tt>memmove</tt> respectively.
</p><p>
Now, I know that <tt>memmove</tt> can be implemented to check which way
the data is to be moved, and to choose the right direction with minimum
performance penalty. I have implemented it myself in just this way. But
every time I am forced to use <tt>memmove</tt> I can't shake a feeling
of personal insult. I mean, I know which way the data should be copied,
so why am I forced to rely on a special function that may or may not be
implemented to do this efficiently? Silly, I know, but is it all that
different from the disdain we all feel toward garbage collectors?
</p><p>
Anyway, <tt>copy</tt> and <tt>copy_n</tt> in cwiclo are guaranteed
to copy forward. To copy backward, use <tt>copy_backward</tt> or
<tt>copy_backward_n</tt>. All four return the iterator pointing to
the last copied element, which is the end of the destination range for
<tt>copy</tt> and its beginning for <tt>copy_backward</tt>.
</p><p>
To copy into an uninitialized memory there is <tt>uninitialized_copy
(f,l,t)</tt> and <tt>uninitialized_copy_n (f,n,t)</tt>, which in-place
copy-construct each destination element. You can move elements using
<tt>uninitialized_move</tt> and <tt>uninitialized_move_n</tt>, which
call move constructors on destination elements. All these can expand
to a plain <tt>rep movs</tt> for trivial types.
</p>

<h2>shift and rotate</h2>
<p>
My problems with copy direction mainly arise from working with untyped
buffers, needing to either insert or delete something in the middle of
them. This situation being very common, cwiclo and the C++20 standard
library add <tt>shift_left (f,l,n)</tt> and <tt>shift_right (f,l,n)</tt>
to shift data in the given range by <tt>n</tt> elements in the explicitly
given direction, using the correct copy direction.
</p><p>
Variations for plain arrays are also implemented as <tt>shift_left
(a,n)</tt> and <tt>shift_right (a,n)</tt>.
</p><p>
The classic <tt>rotate (f,m,l)</tt> is available here, but is explicitly
implemented only for pointers to trivial types, moving memory directly.
</p>

<h2>fill</h2>
<p>
Filling memory with data is another core operation and should likewise
be done with <tt>rep stos</tt> whenever possible for the same reasons
given above. <tt>fill (f,l,v)</tt> and <tt>fill_n (f,n,v)</tt> are
provided for this purpose and will correctly chose to either use a
loop with assignment, or a direct <tt>rep stos</tt> for trivial types.
Unlike <tt>memset</tt>, which only writes single bytes, these fill
functions can load small types of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes into a register
and <tt>rep stos</tt> them, living the dream close to the metal.
</p><p>
Because once again C++ won't let us tell the compiler to use a string
instruction, <tt>rep_stos (f,n,v)</tt> function is provided with
<tt>f</tt> passed as a pointer by reference, taking advantage of the
hardware being able to advance the pointer during the fill. Just like
the <tt>fill</tt> implementation, you too can <tt>bit_cast</tt> small
trivial types to an integer and fill to your heart's content.
</p><p>
The special case of filling with zero is worth supporting explicitly with
<tt>zero_fill (f,l)</tt> and <tt>zero_fill_n (f,n)</tt>, which will call
<tt>memset</tt> to zero trivial types. There is also a <tt>zero_fill
(a)</tt> for directly zeroing plain arrays. The compiler is able to
optimize this better than usual, working around its aversion to untyped
storage and often using the correct single store instructions, such as
<tt>movaps</tt> for zeroing 16-byte blocks. The use of <tt>memset</tt>
also makes both of these functions <tt>constexpr</tt>, which can be
quite useful for overcoming the compiler's usual squeamishness about
zeroing static data in large blocks.
</p><p>
Uninitialized memory can be filled with <tt>uninitialized_fill (f,l,v)</tt>
and <tt>uninitialized_fill_n (f,n,v)</tt>, which in-place construct each
destination element from <tt>v</tt>. For trivially constructible types
this reduces to the usual <tt>rep stos</tt>.
</p>

<h2>C++ ABI</h2>
<p>
To remove any necessity of linking with the very large (and
difficult to find on some platforms) C++ support libraries, cwiclo
implements the ABI stubs emitted by the compiler for some language
constructs. There are calls like <tt>__cxa_call_unexpected</tt>,
<tt>__cxa_pure_virtual</tt>, <tt>__cxa_deleted_virtual</tt>,
<tt>__cxa_bad_cast</tt>, <tt>__cxa_bad_typeid</tt> (from
<tt>-frtti</tt>), <tt>__cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length</tt>,
<tt>__cxa_throw_bad_array_length</tt> (from array new). These are all
implemented as aliases to <tt>std::terminate</tt>.
</p><p>
Not using <tt>-fno-threadsafe-statics</tt> will emit
<tt>__cxa_guard_acquire</tt>, <tt>__cxa_guard_release</tt>,
and <tt>__cxa_guard_abort</tt>, which are implemented using
<tt>atomic_flag</tt>.
</p><p>
For debugging, <tt>print_backtrace</tt> is implemented to dump a backtrace
in debug builds. <tt>hexdump (p,n)</tt> and <tt>hexdump (a)</tt> are
implemented to print raw memory contents with you are totally stuck.
